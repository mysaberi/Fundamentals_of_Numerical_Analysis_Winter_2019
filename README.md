In this course, I learned about the convergence and robustness of different algorithms.<\br>
I studied numerical solutions for the system of Linear/Nonlinear Equations by interpolation methods like Newton and Lagrange. I also learned about various approaches for numerical integration like Gaussian and Romberg.
The lecturer of this course was Prof.Yousefi.
Here are some of the methods I implemented.
