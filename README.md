In this course, I learned about numerical solutions for the system of Linear/Nonlinear Equations by interpolation methods like Newton and Lagrange. I also learned about various approaches for numerical integration like Gaussian and Romberg.</br>
The lecturer of this course was Prof.Yousefi.</br>
Here are some of the methods I implemented.
